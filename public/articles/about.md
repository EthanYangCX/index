Hello, my name is Chenxi Yang (楊晨曦) and here is my portfolio. 
By the way, my English name is Ethan if you prefer the English name. 
I chose the English name mostly because E-Than-Yang sounds like Xi-Chen-Yang and Hei-San-Yeung,
which are Mandarin and Cantonese pronunciations of my Chinese name reversed.

# The Domain Name

The name `yangchnx` is formed by removing all vowel letters from my given name.

# An Alternative Domain Name

The domain name "yangcxyo" consists of my surname Yang (楊), the abbreviation of my given name Chen-xi 
(Chen (晨) and Xi (曦) are two characters), and "yo".
It is chosen firstly because the names "yang", "yangcx", "cxyang", 
"chenxiyang", "yangchenxi", "ethanyang" are all taken, and I had to add some thing to my most preferred 
domain names.
The additional "yo" can be first understood as cool greetings to all of you coming to my website.
It means "I" in Spanish.
It is also related to my surname, 楊. In Japanese, 楊 is pronounced exactly as Yō (よう), and since Japanese 
is my third language and I enjoyed the time when I did my minor degree in Japanese and called Yō-sensei 
(not in the strict meaning), it is worthwhile add this part in memory. Besides, 楊 is pronounced in many 
languages (Sino-Xenic pronunciations) and dialects in different but interrelated ways, for what Yang and Yo are very representative:
most of them have a semivowel or an approximant consonant at beginning, with a main vowel somewhat open and back, 
and a nasal element that could be implemented with a back nasal consonant in the end, or nasalization
of the main vowel, or just lost in history. Examples are /iaŋ/ in Putonghua (杨, yáng) and many other Northern variants of 
Mandarin Chinese, /jaŋ/ (양) in Korean,
/jɨɐŋ/ (reconstructed) in Guangyun (廣韻, Middle Chinese), /iã/ in some Southwestern Mandarin, /ɦiã/ in Shanghai Wu Chinese,
/ɦi/ in Wenzhou Wu Chinese, /jœŋ/ in Canton and Hong Kong Cantonese, /iũ/, /tsʰiũ/ or /iɔŋ/ in many variants of Hokkien,
/iẽ/ or /iaŋ/ in Teochew, /ioŋ/ in Meizhou Hakka, /ʝa/ in Hmong, /jaɴ/ (ရန်) in Burmese,
/joː/ (よう) (historically /jau/ (やう)) in Japanese, /zɨəŋ/ (Dương) in Vietnam, etc. Yang and Yo reflect 
the most important similarities of most of the variants, especially their romanizations, and yo is one of the 
shortest ones that is easy to use in my domain name, so it is selected.
